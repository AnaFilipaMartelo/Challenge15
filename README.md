# AI Retirement Robo Advisor

In this project, we will leverage the power of Amazon Web Services (AWS), Python, and AI-driven technologies to create an intelligent robo advisor aimed at recommending personalized investment portfolios for retirement planning. 

Project Deliverables:

-**Lambda Function Script**: A Python script containing the final Lambda function code that validates user inputs, processes data, and generates personalized retirement investment portfolio recommendations.

- **Demo Videos or GIFs**:
  - **Demo of Robo Advisor Interaction**: A short video demonstrating the user's interaction with the robo advisor through the "Test bot" pane. Showcase how the bot engages in a conversation to gather requirements and provide investment recommendations.
